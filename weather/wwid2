```

**Key changes:**
- `Table_Number` column now contains "Table 123:" (including the colon)
- `Caption` column contains only the text after the colon, with leading/trailing spaces removed
- Changed variable name from `tableName` to `tableNumber` for clarity

**Example output:**
```
Table_Number,Caption
"Table 1:","Summary of quarterly results"
"Table 2:","Employee demographics by region"
