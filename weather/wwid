Paragraph 1: 
have list of all hf model factors, create the long list of risk drivers into the short list. 

Explain rational on why we are not using some of them. 
make clear all past risk factors were considered and which ones were discarded and why. 

Make comment that we cover the themes of HF risk drivers. 

Threshold to define continuous variables, specially new variables, are they categorical. What is the threshold? how is it defined the categories thresholds.

Look at 5.2.2. on what categories of risk drivers for the risk rivers based on EBA Guideline for pd estimation. Add this as a column in the long list of drivers. 
Also reference if risk drivers are more TTC as per Table 1, as table and says if they are TTC or PiT for each risk driver. 

Add expected relationship with the target variable. 

Reference evidence of approval of the variables in terms of EP approving the model risk drivers. 

Also get confirmation from EP that there is consistency over time that what is high quality in 2015 is the same as high quality 2025. 


Paragraph 2: 
check numerical values of the categories. 
- Key person risk, add that to the description that there are minor observation. 
- Risk and control. Explain the mapping or justify the mapping. Check the numerical values of the two categories and see if they are aligned.
- Operation infrastructure, justify the mapping from business.
-   


Paragraph 3: 
- Share paper with IMR. 
- Map themes of the SP with the themes of our model. 


IMR will send feedback on this.
